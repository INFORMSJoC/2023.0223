## Description

The goal of this repository is to share data and results related to the Integrated Location and Routing (ILR) problem within a large-scale solar power plant, solved using our exact solution approach.

## Data

The instances are originally collected from the Hubei Branch of the [State Grid Corporation of China](http://www.sgcc.com.cn/html/sgcc_main_en/index.shtml). All sensitive or confidential information has been appropriately desensitized.

Each instance (denoted by "district_`<span>`$a$-`<span>`$b$") represents a grid-connected solar power plant with a set of photovoltaic arrays (PVAs) continuously placed in a PV farm. Here, $a$ is the number of districts, and $b$ is an index representing different layout shapes. Each district in these plants has 109 slots of PVAs, one of which is removed to install an inverter.

Please see the [data](data) directory to view the data and detailed descriptions.

## Results

The results present the optimal solutions for all instances, solved using our exact solution approach. We develop exact algorithms to solve the ILR problem through a decomposition framework, which yields a variant of Benders decomposition and guarantees an optimal solution. Additionally, we implement an exact branch-and-cut scheme to solve each subproblem within the decomposition framework, integrating cutting planes and separation algorithms to enhance solution precision.

Please see the [results](results) directory to view the optimal solutions and detailed descriptions.

## Building

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Libraries: Gurobi, NumPy

### Structure

The source code is available in the [src](src) directory and includes the following components:

- `data.py`: Defines the `Data` class, which manages the problem data.
- `solution.py`: Contains the `ResultMaster`, `ResultWorker`, and `Solution` classes, which represent the solutions generated during the algorithm's iterations.
- `subproblem_solver.py`: Provides the `DistrictSolver` class for solving subproblems within individual districts.
- `utils.py`: Contains global utility functions used to iteratively solve the ILR problem using the decomposition algorithm.
- `main.py`: Houses the main execution logic to invoke the appropriate functions and run the algorithm.

### Run

Execute the program as follows:

```bash
python main.py <file_path_1> <file_path_2>
```

The arguments are explained as follows:

- `<file_path_1>`: Specifies the file path for the instance to be solved (available in the [data/instances](data/instances) directory).
- `<file_path_2>`*(optional)* : Specifies the file path to save the solution generated by the algorithm (refer to the [results](results) directory).

## Support
